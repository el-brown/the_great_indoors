      <p>Michaela - He was the top of the class and I always looked up to him for that.</p>
      <p>Elise - I kept thinking he lived in Daybreak. Just another straight white male with a hat, I guess.</p>
      <p>Kelsey - I just wish I was like Tom. I wish I had his tenacity and determination to expand upon digital horizons. </p>
